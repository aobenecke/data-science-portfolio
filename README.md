### Project Approach

Market expansion involves many moving parts, including generating an analysis of the size of your new market. In order to prepare as a company, it is important to understand how likely a given product is to sell in new areas. This can be achieved by gaining insights into what factors may predict product sales in your current market, especially factors you can get about the new market you are entering. 

In this analysis, I will use publicly available data to group market areas with similar demographic characteristics. Then, product sales will be compared between these groups to examine if meaningful differences exist. That is, **do existing market areas comprised of similar population demographics interact with the product in predictable ways?**

If market areas can be grouped in this way, we can examine demographics in the new market to see what group each best falls into. **Group behaviors can be used to estimate product sales in the new similar markets.** The advantage of this approach is that it relies only on publicly available data when moving into new areas.

In short, the aim of this analytical approach is to use what we do know (publicly-available data) to predict what we don't know (what product sales might look like in a new market) by sorting similar markets into a finite set of groups.

### Project data

- Demographic is gathered from the US Census (Table DP03 *Selected Economic Characteristics*)
- Company sales data is represented by a Kaggle dataset on electric vehicles (EVs) available for Washington state. For this scenario, we will predict EV sales in Ohio (proposed new market)
